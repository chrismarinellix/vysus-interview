You're interviewing a candidate who has 8 years of utility experience but admits they've never used PSCAD, only PSS/E. Your project pipeline includes several GFM BESS projects requiring extensive PSCAD work. What's your assessment?

A) Reject the candidate - PSCAD experience is non-negotiable for GFM work.

================================================================================

QUESTION 5 - NER Grid Code Compliance (Hard - 100 points)
A Generator Proponent (GP) is submitting a DMAT report (R1). The study shows a 100ms overshoot in reactive power (Q) recovery under a 1.0 pu voltage step disturbance (S5.2.5.13). The GPS requires the response to settle within 40ms. What is the most likely cause and appropriate resolution in the model?

A) The PPC (Plant Primary Controller)'s outer loop has excessively high proportional gain (Kp), necessitating a reduction in Kp and an increase in the integration time constant (Ti) on the inner control loops. ✓ CORRECT
B) The AVR (Automatic Voltage Regulator) has been incorrectly modeled with a Type 3 exciter, which must be swapped for a Type 4 and the inner loop transient gain increased.
C) The Inner Current Controller (ICC)'s reactive current limitation setting is too restrictive, requiring the LVRT logic to be disabled during the voltage step.
D) The PPC's voltage control droop is set too high, but the issue is non-critical as the NSP's concern is transient stability, not voltage recovery, which is handled in R2.

================================================================================

QUESTION 6 - NER Grid Code Compliance (Hard - 100 points)
In an R2 Model Validation study for a 200MW BESS, the model fails to replicate the recorded active power (P) oscillation after a local fault clearance. The PPC is confirmed to be using Grid-Following (GFL) mode. What is the most probable issue requiring model modification?

A) The SCR (Short Circuit Ratio) used in the test model is lower than the actual test SCR, requiring a 20ms delay on the inverter FRT logic.
B) The AVR's measurement filter time constant is 10ms, which is too slow, necessitating a reduction to 5ms to match the recorded response.
C) The Q injection strategy during the fault is incorrectly prioritizing active power priority, and the PPC must be tuned to prioritize Iq over Ip during the recovery phase. ✓ CORRECT
D) The inertia parameter in the GFL model is not representing the true system inertia contribution, requiring an increase in the BESS's virtual inertia setting.

================================================================================

QUESTION 7 - NER Grid Code Compliance
NER S5.2.5.5 (Fault Ride Through) requires compliance with both LVRT and HVRT. During a LVRT study using a full system model, the inverter trips prematurely. The most likely cause is that the:

A) PPC is losing synchronization due to an excessively fast PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) bandwidth (> 10Hz) under depressed voltage conditions. ✓ CORRECT
B) Reactive current priority (K-factor) is set to 0.5 which fails to provide the minimum required Q injection, leading to a FRT trip.
C) The DC link voltage protection is configured for instantaneous tripping when the voltage drops below 0.8 pu, which is incorrect for LVRT.
D) The NSP-provided R2 test methodology incorrectly specifies a CBF (Circuit Breaker Failure) fault, which the model cannot successfully clear.

================================================================================

QUESTION 8 - NER Grid Code Compliance
A GP proposes a new PPC tuning for S5.2.5.13 (V&Q Control) that improves transient response but results in minor LVRT non-compliance in PSCAD. The most justifiable technical justification for the GPS to accept the tuning is that:

A) The LVRT non-compliance is based on an overly conservative SMIB (Single-Machine Infinite Bus) model, which will be mitigated by the system-damping in the full network. ✓ CORRECT
B) The V&Q control is a primary operational requirement, whereas LVRT is a contingency, making the operational improvement strategically superior.
C) The minor non-compliance falls within the NSP's MFRT (Maximum Fault Ride Through) tolerance of 10ms beyond the required voltage-time curve.
D) The tuning maintains the K-factor at 2.0 throughout the fault, thus overriding any instantaneous LVRT trip logic.

================================================================================

QUESTION 9 - NER Grid Code Compliance
NER S5.2.5.15 addresses frequency control. A 250MW Solar Farm is being assessed for MFRT. The most crucial PPC parameter to tune to demonstrate capability under this clause is the:

A) Inverter's PLL bandwidth, which must be reduced to 0.5 Hz to ensure frequency stability.
B) Inverter's Active Power Frequency Droop Setting (3%-5% typical), used to provide FDR (Frequency Disturbance Ride-Through). ✓ CORRECT
C) Inverter's LVRT threshold setting, as low voltage is the cause of most frequency events.
D) PPC's V&Q droop to ensure sufficient voltage support during frequency excursions.

================================================================================

QUESTION 10 - Dynamic Simulation & Software
When modeling a large wind farm in PSCAD, the engineer observes non-characteristic, high-frequency oscillations (50Hz-100Hz) under normal operating conditions. What is the most likely modeling error in the PSCAD setup?

A) The PLL control gains are too low, causing a slow and oscillatory current response.
B) The PCC (Point of Common Coupling) is incorrectly modeled as an ideal voltage source, ignoring the actual grid impedance.
C) The Inverter control system sampling time step is too large (50 μs), leading to numerical instability in the EMT model. ✓ CORRECT
D) The DC Link Capacitor is underrated, leading to excessive voltage ripple.

================================================================================

A) Modify the model to ensure Q priority is maintained for 100ms then switch to P priority for faster recovery.
B) Change the model to use a dynamic K-factor that is a function of the instantaneous AC voltage magnitude. ✓ CORRECT
C) Reduce the overall system SCR in the PSS/E network to reflect worst-case conditions.
D) Switch from the PSS/E generic REEC model to a REPC model for improved PPC representation.

A) The SMIB model's infinite bus has a fixed SCR of 1.0, which is always lower than the full network SCR.
B) The SMIB model lacks the inter-area oscillation modes and SCR dependency, which can cause the PLL to de-synchronize in the full model. ✓ CORRECT
C) The SMIB model uses an aggregated REEC/REPC structure, which ignores the collector network impedances present in the full model.
D) The SMIB's large equivalent inertia masks the IBRs' reliance on system strength.
